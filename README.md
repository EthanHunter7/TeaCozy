# TeaCozy Project From Codecademy

This is an off platform coding project using HTML and CSS to build and design the website. I was given a Mockup for the webpage so i had to follow what was specified for each element on the page. So I had to make sure everything was laid out properly with the correct styles added. 

I also decided to make it resposive using CSS FlexBox and Media so it can adjust to different screen size and still look good.
